Ⅳ. Selected Paragraph

Do not treat all new words in exactly the same way. Have you ever complained about your memory because you find it simply impossible to memorize all the new words you are learning? But, in fact, it is not your memory that is at fault. If you cram your head with too many new words at a time, some of them are bound to be crowded out. What you need to do is to deal with new words in different ways according to how frequently they occur in everyday use. While active words demand constant practice and useful words must be committed to memory, words that do not often occur in everyday situations require just a nodding acquaintance. You will find concentrating on active and useful words the most effective route to enlarge your vocabulary.

 

    不要以完全同样的方式对待所有的生词。你可曾因为简直无法记住所学的所有生词而抱怨自己的记忆力太差？其实，责任并不在你的记忆力。如果你一下子把太多的生词塞进头脑，必定有一些生词会被挤出来。你需要做的是根据生词日常使用的频率以不同的方式对待它们。积极词汇需要经常练习，有用的词汇必须牢记，而在日常情况下不常出现的词只需见到时认识即可。你会发现把注意力集中于积极有用的词上是扩大词汇量最有效的途径。

IV. Selected Paragraph

The years passed. He gave up flying and began sailing. He enjoyed it greatly. Chichester was already 58 years old when he won the first solo transatlantic race. His old dream of going around the world came true, but this time he would sail. His friends and doctors did not think he could do it, as he had lung cancer. But Chichester was determined to carry out his plan. In August, 1966, at the age of nearly sixty-five, an age when many men retire, he began the greatest voyage of his life. Soon, he was away in his new 16-meter boat, Gispsy Moth.

Let us take a serious, reasonable look at what the results might be if such a proposal were accepted. Families might use the time for a real family hour.

IV. Selected Paragraph

People ask what college I attended, what degree I have, and what qualifications I have to be a writer.  The answer is none. I just write.   I’m not a genius, I’m not gifted and don’t write right.  I’m not disciplined, either, and spend more time with my children and friends than I do writing.  I didn’t own a thesaurus until four years ago and I use a small Webster’s dictionary that I bought for 89 cents.  I use an electric typewriter that I paid $129 for six years ago.  I have never used a word processor.  I do all the cooking, cleaning and laundry for a family of six and fit my writing in a few minutes here and there.  I write everything in longhand while sitting on the sofa with my four kids, eating pizza and watching TV.  When the book is finished, I type it and mail it to the publisher.

Ⅳ. Selected Paragraph

    I went to the plant and spent about a week looking around and making notes.  I was really amazed at what I saw.  Most curious of all, there was no quality control whatsoever.  No one inspected the final products of the factory.  As a result some of the shirts that were put in boxes for shipment were missing one or two buttons, the collar, even a sleeve sometimes!  The working conditions were poor.  The tables where the workers sat were very high and uncomfortable.  Except for a half hour at lunchtime, there were no breaks in the day to relieve the boring work.  I was amazed that the workers hadn’t gone on strike.

   我来到厂里，花了一个星期左右的时间一边到处查看，一边做些笔记。说真的，我对看到的情况不胜惊讶。最为奇怪的是，厂里竟然没有任何质量控制。没有人检验工厂生产的产品。结果，有些装箱待运的衬衫不是缺了一两粒纽扣，就是少了衣领，有时甚至还会少只袖子。工厂的生产条件很差。工作台很高，工人坐在旁边很不舒服。  除了吃中饭的半个小时外，全天没有别的休息时间来调剂一下令人厌倦的工作。使我感到惊奇的是，工人们竟然没有罢工。

IV. Selected Paragraph

The elderly gentleman, who was poorly but neatly dressed, accepted the spoon and began eagerly to sample one after another of the puddings, only breaking off occasionally to wipe his red eyes with a large torn handkerchief.  All the time it was evident that he sincerely believed that he might eventually buy one of these puddings, and I am positive that he did not for a moment feel that he was in any way cheating the store.  Poor old chap!  Probably he had come down in the world and this sampling was all that was left him from the time when he could afford to come and select his favorite pudding.                                   

这位老先生衣着虽然破旧，但却十分整洁。他接过调羹，便开始急切地一只接一只地品尝起来，只是偶尔停下来，用一方大的破手绢擦擦他的红眼睛。有一点至始至终很明显：他真诚地相信自己最终也许会买一只布丁；而我也确信，他一点也不觉得自己是在欺骗商店。可怜的老头儿！很可能他已经家道败落。从前他是有钱来选购他最喜爱的布丁的，而今却只能这样来品尝一下布丁的味道了。

IV. Selected Paragraph

I was deeply moved by the discovery and yet sickened by the knowledge that,
 bursting into her room like this, I had robbed her of the pleasure of seeing
 me astonished and delighted on Christmas day. I hadn’t wanted to know her
 lovely secret; still coming upon it like this made me feel as though I’d struck
 a blow against her happiness. I backed out, put the key back in its hiding place,
 and thought over what to do.

I decided that between now and Christmas I must do nothing, absolutely nothing,
 to reveal the slightest hint of my terrible knowledge. I must avoid the least
 word that might reveal my possession of her secret. Nothing must deny her the
 happiness of seeing me completely amazed on Christmas day.

这一发现让我深为感动，然而想到这样闯进她的卧室，从而剥夺了她在圣诞节那天见到我又惊又喜时的欢乐，
我又感到厌恶。我本不想知道她这个可爱的秘密；但像这样偶然地发现了它竟然使我觉得好像重重地打击了
她的欢乐一样。我从她的卧室退了出来，把钥匙放回原处，认真考虑着该怎么办才好。

我决定，在现在和圣诞节之间这段时间里，我必须不动声色，绝对不可露出一点蛛丝马迹暗示我已令人讨厌地
知道了此事。我必须谨言慎行，不能让她知道我已掌握了她的秘密。必须想尽一切办法让她在圣诞节那天享受到
看见我极为惊讶时的快乐。

Ⅳ. Reading Comprehension (2 x 10)

Directions: There are 2 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. You should decide on the best choice and mark your answer by blackening the corresponding letter.  



Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage:

The only way you can become a good reader is through practice. You can not read a few paragraphs in your English book once and become a fluent reader. You need to read constantly. You should carry something to read with you wherever you go. Take an English magazine, for example, and carry it in your pocket. Whenever you have the chance, turn on a page and read a paragraph or two.

You should read in as many different subject areas as you can. You should try to find English books on different subjects and read a few paragraphs in each chapter in each book. Your eyes and mind need to practice. Your eyes need to practice moving quickly from left to right, and your mind needs to practice making quick associations between the printed words and meaning.

When you begin to read you should ask yourself a basic question: Why am I reading this? If you are reading to practice your English, you will read in a certain way. You will read slowly and concentrate on the relationship between the words and the grammatical structures. If you are reading for information about a particular subject, you will read in another way. You will focus on main parts and supporting facts. You use the grammar of the passage as a means, not an end. 

Reading to practice English is the way most foreign students read English. In school you do not read English to learn about a particular subject, for example, you do not read English to learn history. You read English to learn how a sentence is put together, how the verbs agree with the subjects, what the clause is, etc.



第46题:

To become a good reader you need to ________.

A. have a large vocabulary

B. understand grammar

C. read a lot

D. move your eyes across pages quickly  



第47题:  

With which statement would the author agree?

A. You read anything with the same skills

B. You read a newspaper differently from a textbook

C. Reading from right to left is an important skill

D. You should read only the material that interests you  



第48题:  

When most students read to learn a foreign language, ________.

A. they read every word

B. they only read the important words

C. they keep asking themselves “why am I reading this”

D. they often lose patience  



第49题:  

When you are reading for information, you use grammar ________.

A. as a tool, not as your purpose

B. as your purpose, not a tool

C. as both your purpose and a tool

D. as neither your purpose nor a tool  



第50题:  

When you read to practice English, you have to ________.

A. learn what the clause is

B. learn how the verbs agree with the subjects

C. learn how a sentence is put together

D. do all of the above.

Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage:

I did not know the city at all and what is more, I could not speak a word of the language. After having spent my first day sightseeing in the town center, I decided to lose my way deliberately on my second day, since I believed that was the surest way of getting to know my way around. I got on the first bus that passed and descended some thirty minutes later in what must have been a suburb. 

The first two hours passed pleasantly enough. I discovered mysterious little bookshops in back streets and finally arrived at a market place where I stopped and had a coffee in an open-air café. Then I decided to go back to my hotel for lunch. After walking about aimlessly for some time, I determined to ask the way. The trouble was that the only word I knew of the language was the name of the street in which I stayed—and even that I pronounced badly.

I stopped to ask a newspaper-seller. He smiled and handed me a paper. I shook my head and repeated the name of the street and he thrust the paper into my hands. Seeing that it would be impossible to argue about the matter, I gave him some money went on my way. The next person I asked was an old lady who was buying vegetables. She was very hard of hearing and I repeated the word several times. When she finally heard me, she seemed to take offence and began shouting and shaking her walking stick at me. I hurried away quickly and was relieved to see a policeman on a corner.

The policeman listened to my question, smiled and gently took me by the arm. There was a distant look in his eyes as he pointed left and right and left again. I nodded politely and began walking in the direction he pointed. About an hour passed and I noticed that the houses were getting fewer and fewer and green fields were appearing on either side of me. I had come all the way into the country. The only thing left for me to do was to find the nearest railway station!

第60题:  

他们已安排好让我们明天去游览长城，我相信我们在那儿一定会玩的很开心。 
They have arranged for us to visit the Great Wall tomorrow. I’m sure we’ll have a good time there. 



Let us take a serious, reasonable look at what the results might be if such a proposal were accepteD. Families might use the time for a real family hour. Without the distraction of TV, they might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems—everything, in fact, from the generation gap to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illness—are caused at least in part by failure to communicate. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better. 

 让我们认真而通情达理地看一下，如果这一建议被采纳的话，会有什么样的结果。千家万户也许会利用这段时间真正地团聚一番。没有电视的干扰，他们在晚饭后也许会围坐在一起当真相互交谈起来。众所周知，我们的许多问题――事实上是所有的问题，从代沟、高离婚率到某些精神病――至少部分地是由于没能交流思想而引起的。利用这安静的、全家相聚的时刻来讨论我们的各种问题，我们相互之间会更加了解，更加相爱。

Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage:

Some people would say that the Englishman's home has become his workshop. This is partly because the Englishman is deeply interested in working with his hands and partly because he feels that he must do for himself many household jobs for which some years ago he would have asked for workers' help. The main reason for this is a financial one: the high cost of labour has meant that builders' and decorators' costs have reached a level which is too high for ordinary people. So, if they wish to keep their houses looking bright and smart, they have to do some of the repairing and decorating themselves. As a result, there has grown up the “Do-It-Yourself Movement” after World War II.

The “Do-It-Yourself Movement” began with decorating but has since spread into a much wider fielD. Nowadays there seem to be very few things that cannot be made by the “do-it-yourself ” methoD. A number of magazines and handbooks exist to show just how easy it is to build anything from a coffee table to a fifteen-foot sailing boat. You follow the simple directions step by step and, before you know where you are the finished article stands before you complete in every detail.

Unfortunately, it is not always quite as simple as it sounds! Many people have found that one cannot learn a skilled worker's job overnight. How quickly one realizes, when doing it oneself, that a job which takes the skilled man an hour or so to complete takes him five or six at least. And there is the question of tools which cost money. It is not surprising then that many people have come to realize that the money of paying the workers to do the job is, in fact, less than “do it oneself“.



第46题:  

An Englishman's home has become a workshop because he _________.

A. tries to work with his own hands to save some money

B. wants to have some physical training at home

C. wants to earn some money in his spare time by working at home

D. has some people work for him at home at the weekend  

 

第47题:  

The word “financial” ( Line 5, ParA. 1) has something to do with _________.

A. social position  B. house repair  C. decorating skills  D. money  



第48题:  

The “Do-It-Yourself Movement” is _________.

A. an organization which helps women look for good jobs

B. a group of people who help each other

C. an activity many people now take part in

D. the name of a very popular magazine in Britain  



第49题:  

According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true?

A. Before starting a repairing job, one must first study the methods for some time.

B. Some books tell people that it is not too difficult to build a small boat.

C. It needs both skills and tools to do a good job. 

D. It is not as easy as some people think to make a coffee table.  



第50题:

A. likes to have the jobs done by skilled workers

B. advises us to do some easy jobs by ourselves

C. realizes that some people can learn a skilled worker's job easily

D. is strongly against the “Do-It-Yourself Movement”  

 A D C A B

Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage:

Each nation has its own odd character which distinguishes it from others. But the people of the world have more points in which they are all like each other than points in which they are different. One type of person that is common in every country is the one who always tries to do as little as he possibly can and to get as much in return as he can. His opposite, the man who is in the habit of doing more than is strictly necessary and who is ready to accept what is offered in return, is rare everywhere.

Both these types are usually not aware of their character. The man who avoids effort is always talking about his “rights”: he appears to think that society owes his a pleasant, easy life. The man who is always doing more than his share talks of “duties”: he feels that the individual is in debt to society, and not society to the individual. As a result of their views, neither of these men thinks that he behaves at all strangely.

The man who tries to do as little as he can is always full of excuses: if he had neglected to do something, it was because he had a headache, or the weather was too hot—or too cold---or because he was prevented by bad luck. At first, other people, such as his friends and his employer, generously accept his stories; but soon they realized what kind of person he is. In the long run he deceives only himself. When his friends become cool towards his and he fails to make progress in his job, he is surprised and hurt. He blames everyone and everything except himself. He feels that society is failing in its duties towards him, and that he is being unjustly treated. He soon becomes one of the unsatisfied members of the society he lives in.

If you want something done in a hurry, don't go to the man who has clearly not much to do. He will probably have a dozen excellent excuses for not being able to help you, much as he tells you he would like to do. Go to the busiest man you know, particularly if you are sure that he has not a spare minute in the week. If your work is really important, he will make time for it.

A. his friends  B. only himself  C. his employer  D. other people

Ⅵ. Translate the following passage into Chinese. (1 x 15)  



The elderly gentleman, who was poorly but neatly dressed, accepted the spoon and began eagerly to sample one after another of the puddings, only breaking off occasionally to wipe his red eyes with a large torn handkerchief. All the time it was evident that he sincerely believed that he might eventually buy one of these puddings, and I am positive that he did not for a moment feel that he was in any way cheating the store. Poor old chap! Probably he had come down in the world and this sampling was all that was left him from the time when he could afford to come and select his favorite pudding. 

 
这位老先生衣着虽然破旧，但却很整洁。他接过调羹，便开始急切地一只布丁接着一只地品尝起来，只是偶尔停下来，用一块大的破手绢擦擦他的红眼睛。有一点自始至终很明确，他真诚地相信自己最终也许会买一只布丁；而我也相信，他一点也不觉得自己是在欺骗商店。可怜的老头儿！很可能他已经家道败落。从前他是有钱来选购他最喜爱的布丁的，而今却只能来品尝一下布丁的味道了。
